Regions are an important part of Zymono. Regions protect land like spawn, parks, forests, simply anything you
want to protect players. Regions are really powerful because they are configurable and can stop
all actions that happen in an area.

> **Note** This command selects the region that the player is currently standing in.

```bash
-region remove

Or You can remove all regions using:

```bash
-region removeAll
```

### List all regions `["admin"]`

```bash
-region list
```

### Changing Region Permissions `["admin"]`

> **Note**: Default Permissions are stored here: [`src\config\region.ts`](https://github.com/smell-of-curry/rubedo/blob/main/src/config/region.ts)

> **Note**: The `-region permission` command selects the current region the command executer is standing in

```bash
-region permission set <key: doorsAndSwitches | openContainers | pvp> <value: boolean>
```

```
-region permission set pvp false
-region permission set openContainers false
-region permission set doorsAndSwitches true
```

#### Managing what mobs can spawn `["admin"]`

```bash
-region permission entities add <entity: string>
-region permission entities remove <entity: string>
```

```bash
-region permission entities add "minecraft:cow"
-region permission entities remove "minecraft:cow"
```

### List the current permissions for this region `["admin"]`

```bash
-region permission list
```

## Modules:

- **Anti CBE**: Prevents users from using CBE (CommandBlock Exploits) which is done by checking the inventory every tick for these illegal items and clearing it.

- **Anti Crasher**: patches a crashing method (typically used by Horion) that teleports a user 30 million blocks far and kicks a user hopefully preventing the crash.

- **Anti Illegal Enchants**: Checks if a player has a illegal enchantment on a item in there inventory.

- **Anti Gamemode**: Removes creative and clears the user inventory if the user is not an authorized user.

  > **Note**: **THIS IGNORES BUILDERS**

- **Anti NameSpoof**: Checks if player has played before with a different name. WARNING when converting worlds into server clear your database first.

- **Anti Nuker**: works by logging the placement of blocks done by the player and detects if the next block break is done impossibly fast (50 milliseconds) then we cancel the breaking event.

- **ban bad Blocks/items**: Checks if player has a banned item in there inventory, or if a player places a banned block. This list can be configurable in the `-settings`

- **movement**: Added flags that will check for movements like jet pack, fly, speed etc.

# View Player's inventories & Ender Chests

First, you will need to make sure you have admin permission on your server, look at [Permissions](#permissions) for more details

Next give yourself `Rubedo:gui`
by typing in chat:

```bash
/give @s `Rubedo:gui`
```

Next Open your GUI and you should be prompted with this screen

![gui screen that shows a ender chest in middle](https://i.ibb.co/Bf0dDVN/Captusdsdsdsdre.png)

Next to view a list of players click on the ender chest, then you should be
prompted with this screen

![gui screen that shows a list of all players in the world](https://i.ibb.co/QjQXKP0/2Capture.png)

This screen should show each player in the world with a player head with their name as the nameTag
Click a player you want to view, then you will be shown their inventory:

![gui screen that shows a players inventory](https://i.ibb.co/Hg1fd9b/3Capture.png)

When clicking on items in the player's inventory it will remove them from the player's inventory and give
you the item

> **Note**: to view the players ender chest click the ender chest icon at the bottom of the gui screen

Once you open up the player's ender chest it should look like this:

![gui screen that shows a players ender chest](https://i.ibb.co/yQWnX7v/4Capture.png)

When clicking on items it will remove those items from their ender chest and give them to you

> **Note**: THIS SYSTEM **CANNOT** GRAB ANY NBT OF THE ITEM. ONLY THE ITEM ID

# Command Arguments

### **PlayerName**

The playerName argument is a very special argument, it allows players to input playersNames and use it in commands

> **Note**: The argument allows you to input a player name. If the players name has spaces make sure to include quotes
> around the name

> **Warning** **: This argument can throw errors if a player has never joined the server before**

Syntax:

```batch
playerNameWithNoSpaces
"Player name with spaces"
```

### **Player**

The `Player` argument type is like `PlayerName` but `PlayerName` can call be used on any player that has ever joined the world
while `Player` can only access players that are in the current game

> **Warning** **: This argument can throw errors if a player is not currently in the game**

Syntax:

```batch
playerNameWithNoSpaces
"Player name with spaces"
```

### **Duration**

The duration argument allows users to input time statements that allow commands like `ban`, `mute` and much more to understand
how long you want a duration to last

The duration argument consists of an array of `DurationArgumentTypes`.
A `DurationArgumentTypes` consists of a `number` and `unit`

`unit`'s can be one of `"y" | "w" | "d" | "h" | "m" | "s" | "ms"`

Where:
`"y"` is years  
`"w"` is weeks  
`"d"` is days  
`"h"` is hours  
`"m"` is minutes  
`"s"` is seconds  
`"ms"` is milliseconds

Syntax:

`10d` - 10 days  
`4d,5m` - 4 days and 5 minutes  
`5h,30m` - 5 hours and 30 minutes  
`100000d` - 100000 days  
`2y,5d,8s` - 2 years 5 days and 8 seconds  
`4h,3m,5s,20ms` - 4 hours, 3 minutes, 5 seconds and 20 milliseconds

## Configuration

Zymono has made it so easy to edit all of its config files in-game. Most Anti cheats make it so
you have to know how to edit files and make packs, but with Zymono you can do it all in-game
with the `-settings` command!

Once you run:

```bash
-settings
```

in chat you will be prompted to close your chat screen. Once you do so a form should be prompted up
on your screen. In this screen you can edit things like AutoMod, Banned Items, Banned Blocks, Enchantments, And the Appeal Link!

## Support

As Zymono is Still in beta, there might be bugs that you could face. If you need support PLEASE send us an email at info@zymono.com
